# What is Reactor?

Reactor is a contract domain specific language (DSL) for modeling both insurance and reinsurance contracts. Inspired by the paper, "How to write a financial contract," by Simon Peyton-Jones and Jean Marc Eber. I have adapted and extended their work to the domain of re/insurance contracts. 

Contracts in the re/insurance domain have unique contract terms that require an additional set of primitive values and an industry specific way to evaluate these contracts.
